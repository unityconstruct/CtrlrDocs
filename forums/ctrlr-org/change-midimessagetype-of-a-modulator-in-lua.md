# change-midimessagetype-of-a-modulator-in-lua

And generaly how to get correct formula when you see a parameter interesting in Utility and don‚Äôt ask to others ?

I see 3 classes of modulator parameter:modulator, midi and conponent  but i remember i‚Äôve seen a day  a request as ‚ÄúgetConponent ‚Äù for a ‚Äúmodulator‚Äù parameter or the inverse so i‚Äôm not sure‚Ä¶.

Your question made me curious on how this can be done , fooled around a bit and managed to get midi message types to change üôÇ
Changing the values of the other properties did not work through Lua at this time, probably because i am not using the exact correct syntax of the properties, I always end up with extra properties attached to the component üòÜ
I guess i have to use escape characters to skip the spaces in properties like ‚ÄúMIDI Controller number‚Äù? Time to study those‚Ä¶

But setting the values of the properties by hand and the switching between types works.

Here‚Äôs an example of a combobox  changing the midi-message type of another modulator:

```lua
switchMidiType = function(mod, value)

    sel = panel:getModulatorByName("modulator-2"):getValue()
    modToChange = panel:getModulatorByName("modulator-1"):getMidiMessage()

    if sel == 0 then
        modToChange:setPropertyInt("midiMessageType",9) -- none is 9th option
    elseif sel == 1 then
        modToChange:setPropertyInt("midiMessageType",0) -- CC is 0th option
    elseif sel == 2 then
        modToChange:setPropertyInt("midiMessageType",5) -- sysex is 5th option
    elseif sel == 3 then
        modToChange:setPropertyInt("midiMessageType",1) -- aftertouch is 1st option
    end
end
```

 

I do have to say i can‚Äôt see why you would want to do it this way though. I guess you you want a modulator on one spot to ‚Äúchange‚Äù types, it would be easier to make multiple modulators stacked on top of eachother and switch their visibility. Imo, of course.

As for the ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù picture:

You can access the properties of a modulator‚Äôs parts by ‚Äúgrabbing‚Äù the part you want to manipulate and the (try to) get/set the individual properties.

The above example gets you inside the ‚ÄúMIDI‚Äù part of the modulator, if you want to access the component properties you need to type:
```lua
x = panel:getModulatorByName("yourModHere"):getComponent()

-- And then you can do stuff like
x:setPropertyString("componentVisibleName", "WhateverYouWantTheNameLabelToDisplay")
x:setPropertyInt("componentVisibility", 1) -- to make a modulator visible
x:setPropertyInt("componentVisibility", 0) -- to make a modulator invisible
```

Good luck!

Don‚Äôt do setPropertyInt setPropertyString, setProperty() is enough Ctrlr will figure out what type it is (saves typing).

Also try to avoid calling panel:getModulatorByName() at runtime, this is the biggest mistake people make, in situation where you have hundreds or thousands of modulators in the panel (those static ones count too) Ctrlr needs to go through the table to find the one you want.

If you are done with designing your panel you can type somewhere in the init method for a panel
```lua
modulator1 = panel:getModulatorByName("modulator1")
component1 = modulator1:getComponent()

-- and then later in your code do

modulator1:setProperty("whatever", 0)
component1:getProperty("whatever")
saves time and typing.
```

Thanks Atom, gonna mess with this some more now üôÇ

Also good to know about the getModulatorByName being too taxing @ runtime, i do that all the time‚Ä¶

Knowing stuff like this will make building the next revision of my panel waaaay smoother!

Mainly because in all your examples until now you made use of this method to call a modulator üòÄ

This is the kind of tricks you should talk about in order to optimize a panel.

If we use panel:getModulatorByIndex() Ctrlr goes through the table too?

Ok the theory behind arrays is very interesting, if anyone is interested: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure

In Ctrlr as in most of software in the world all modulators are kepi in a single dimension linear array of size 0 ‚Äì n where n = number of modulators, when you want to fetch a modulator as fast as possible, fetch it using it‚Äôs index, this is the fastest possible method of accessing memory in a computer, you get a pointer to that modulator and you can run methods on it etc.

When trying to access modulators via some other properties (for example their names). You need to go through the array checking each modulators property and comparing it to the name you passed. Now if the modulator is somewhere on top of the array it will be considerably fast but if you have an array of 1000 modulators and the one you are fetching is on the 999 place, that will take loads of time.

You can create an array of modulators that indexed using their names or some other properties, for that you need something called a Hash Table: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table. That takes more memory but it speeds up looking for you data in memory. I did not implement a hash array for modulators, i thought about it, but it never happened. You can do some more research and if you can give me a good reason to implement a hash table for modulators i‚Äôll do that.

Thanks for the info, worth looking.

No, I don‚Äôt need the hash table, we talked about this before and since then I call modulators by it‚Äôs index.

But there is something I miss. How to know the index of a modulator (not the VstIndex as they are not the same). Something like panel:getModulatorByName():getIndex()

# March 13, 2013 at 4:18 pm#7146

atom
That‚Äôs a weird question, cause you don‚Äôt use indexes like that, you use that usually in a loop or something similar. The modulator is not aware of it‚Äôs index in the array, so getModulatorByName():getIndex() won‚Äôt work. I can add a method like that but it would be in the panel object. But if you do:

modulatorIndex = panel:getModulatorByName("name"):getIndex()
and then use modulatorIndex it makes no sense, since it‚Äôs better to fetch the modulator

modulator = panel:getModulatorByName("name")
and then use that object.

Probable a beginners question, but does one assign an index to a modulator in the properties panel under ‚Äòmodulator CustomIndex‚Äô?

No , this is a property of the modulator and is not the index I‚Äôm talking about. The index is assigned automatically once you create a modulator.

I use a lot panel:getModulatorByIndex() instead of panel:getModulatorByName() in methods used when the modulator value change (if I trigger any modulator with another one or link modulators) to avoid going through the list if there can be heavy automation on this modulator hoping to optimize time.

Can‚Äôt we use tables to store links to modulators (or their components/properties) and use keys to get to them when we need them? Or is this also too taxing @ runtime because you still need to iterate over alot of keys?

From what i read here this is similar to using hash tables (the part ‚ÄúTables as dictionaries‚Äù)

Thanks a lot ! very interesting things

I just want disable midi of 5 on 2100 mods when the device dumps to ctrlr or the device controls ctrlr because of my methods (long to explain üôÇ )!!

I would like to use vst index but i can‚Äôt because i can‚Äôt re number EXACTLY mods it‚Äôs too boring.Tried several times : globaly re numbered but always some  resist + if i add a mod it take the number 0 ! Horrible

Modulatorbyname is enough fast for me at this time‚Ä¶

Question : Customindex what is it? i see all the mods are 0 , but may be with this i can make groups and modify in LUA several modulators at once instead of individual requests ? Cool for Visibility?

Hmm.. Strange :

I‚Äôve done :

cutmod1 = panel:getModulatorByName(‚ÄúTrigger Sel. sound‚Äù):getComponent()
cutmod1:setProperty(‚ÄúmidiMessageType‚Äù, 9)  and later

cutmod1:setProperty(‚ÄúmidiMessageType‚Äù, 5)

setProperty does not work and disable LUA

but first i‚Äôve done :

panel:getModulatorByName(‚ÄúTrigger Sel. sound‚Äù):getComponent():setProperty(‚ÄúmidiMessageType‚Äù, 9) and later same thing with 5 instead of 9
And this worked nice but at the end i‚Äôve the same LUA error

I remember i‚Äôve tried same thing some time ago thing with PropertyInt and i had no error but the midi message is sent anyway‚Ä¶

You‚Äôre right i need more important things üòâ

How to get ‚Äúcalled after a panel has finished loading‚Äù  working because my panel don‚Äôt remember midi in/out ( loopback in my head ) ?

May be save that in ‚Äúcalled before a panel is saved‚Äù ?  wah !

Good night

What do you mean it doesn‚Äôt remeber MIDI IN OUT, those settings are always saved across loading Ctrlr at least in standalone mode.

# March 14, 2013 at 3:05 pm#7172

Panels exported to dll don‚Äôt save settings (modulators, midi ports and midi options) inside the Daw. Settings are always those present when the dll was exported.

Even export panel to dll says ‚Äúthe panel could not be created‚Äù (I‚Äôm talking from memory) but the dll is created.
